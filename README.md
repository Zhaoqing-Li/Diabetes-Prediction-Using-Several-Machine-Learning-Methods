# Diabetes-Prediction-Using-Several-Machine-Learning-Methods
I used these databases as traing and testing sets: Electronic Health Records (EHRs), Pima Indians Diabetes Database (PIDD), Sylhet Diabetes Data, Diabetes Dataset on Mendeley Data, Diabetes datasets of Azure Open Datasets, and The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS).

I used these models for prediction: Random Forest, XG Boost, and Support Vector Machine.

The results are shown in the CV10 AUC Results.xlsx
